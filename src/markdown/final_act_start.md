You find yourself wrapped in a thick fog. You can't see much around you, but you can make out a
faint light in the distance. As you approach it, it starts to glow stronger and stronger.
After a few steps, you stand in front of the once small light, now almost filling out your entire 
field of vision. Taking another step forward, you feel yourself getting pulled into the light, by 
some seemingly invisible force. You close your eyes and brace yourself for what's to come.

After you open your eyes again, you find yourself in complete darkness, however a seemingly
omnipresent voice asks you: "Who do you wish to be?" "That's such a hard question, there are far too
many options!" you think to yourself. Suddenly however, it's made to clear to you that you have 
two choices:
- [Be a Warrior](final_act_warrior_start) 
- [Be a Mage](final_act_mage_start) 

Which one will it be?
