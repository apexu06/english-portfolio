You can slightly make out a cave entrance in the distance. The snow makes it hard to see, but you
slowly manage to make your way towards it. Soon, you stand before the entrance, however it's guarded
by a magical barrier. Only those with the so called _Behelith_ can enter. You raise your hand with
the Behelith in it, and the barrier vanishes. As you step inside, you are covered in darkness. The
deeper you go into the cave, the louder you can hear the voices of the other mages. Finally, you can
see something in the distance. The bright shine of a big campfire almost invites you. As you step
into the hall, you are greeted by many other wizards. You know some of them, but most are strangers,
you are quite new yourself. 

There is still some time until the arch mage, _Gandalf_, arrives. You suddenly spot a glowing orb in
the corner of the room, which seems to be calling you in some way. It consumes your whole attention,
you stare at it like idiot. You manage to shake yourself out of it, but you can't help but still
feel drawn to it. Now what will you do, prepare for the arch mage speech or go to the orb?
