"I cannot fight in this condition!", you think to yourself. You decide to make a run for it. While
all the other people in the tavern are still shocked and don't know what to do, you take the chance
and bolt out of the tavern. Three of the goblins decide to chase you, you can hear their footsteps
closely behind you. You run as fast as your alcohol-filled body allows you to. The forest is just
in front of you, therefore you decide to run into it. Hopefully you can lose them there. 

As you run into the embankment, you trip over a root and fall to the ground. You want to get up,
at least you try to, because the floor beneath you collapses and you fall into a dark hole. "Well, I
lost the goblins...", you think to yourself. But now you are stuck in a dark cave, which almost
looks like a nest of some sort. Suddenly, you hear a hissing sound coming from the darkness. You 
are frightened, standing as close to one of the walls as possible. You can't see anything, but 
clearly the thing that is down here can see you. 

All of a sudden, a pair of glowing eyes appear in front of you. You can't see the rest of the 
creature, as it instantly jumps at you. You try to defend yourself, but it's hopeless. 
The last thing you hear are your own screams echoing through the cave.

## You Died!
