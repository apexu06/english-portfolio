description: 'The first full day in Washington DC'
---

Last two days, were much more eventful than I expected them to be. We visited a lot of sights and
saw many more or less interesting things. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and go through it
relatively chronologically.

Monday marked the start of our sightseeing tour in Washington DC. We started off by a guided tour,
where we visited the _Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial_, the _Lincoln Memorial_, the _Vietnam
Veterans Memorial_ and the _Korean War Veterans Memorial_. A lot of memorials, some were more
interesting than others. While the Lincoln Memorial was very impressive due to its sheer size I
found the Korean War Veterans Memorial to be the most interesting. It was pretty unique and it's not
something I had seen before at a memorial.

My friends and I then spent the whole afternoon roaming around in DC, visiting (not so special)
Chinatown, parks and other sights. The smell of weed was normal at this point. There was only one
requirement for the afternoon: we should choose one of the many museums in DC and visit it. My
friend and I chose the _National History Museum_, where we stayed for, let's say, not very long.

After that was said and done, we found a funny looking **library**, went inside and found there to
be an Apple Store instead of books. Only in America, I guess.
Of course, we also looked at the White House and the biggest Obelisk I have ever seen, the
_Washington Monument_.

This piece of brick is honestly massive and very impressive once you stand before it. There's also
this huge grassy area around it, which makes it the perfect spot for a picnic or just to relax. We
spent the rest of the afternoon there, around 45 minutes, just sitting on the grass, talking and
taking some _peculiar_ pictures with the monument in the background. Overall, a very fun day.

Tuesday was supposed to be a bit more relaxed, at least that's what I thought. However, the day
started by visiting _Arlington National Cemetery_, where we almost rushed through because we
apparently had such a tight schedule. Nevertheless, we were lucky and got to see the _Changing of
the Guard_ at the _Tomb of the Unknown Soldier_, which I had only seen in YouTube videos before.
After that was said and done, we went back to the bus (except two girls from parallel class, who
apparently got lost) and drove towards the capitol.

Once we arrived, we had some time for lunch and my friend had the glorious idea of going to the
_Hard Rock Cafe_. Without giving it much thought, I joined him and some other friends. What I didn't
know at first is that we had to walk 25 minutes to get there and 25 minutes back. That doesn't sound
bad until I realized that we only had one hour and 30 minutes for lunch. We rushed through our
meals and made it back just in time.

After our lunch escapade, it was time for a guided tour through the Capitol, which was a major
letdown in my opinion. The guide showed us three rooms, which were all very impressive, but just as
I thought that we were halfway done, it just ended.

After the Capitol, we went into a tunnel of some sort, which led us to the _Library of Congress_. We
didn't have guided tour there, which I was honestly glad about. Nothing much to say about the
library itself, it was just a big room, not even filled with books except one room, which the public
didn't have access to, just great.

That's it for the Washington DC adventures.

Next stop: Mt. Vernon, Air and Space Museum and _Tele Controls_.
