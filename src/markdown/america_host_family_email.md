Hi June,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to tell you about my host family and my experience with them here
in America. First off, it's awesome, I'm having a lot of fun. They live in a typical American house
in the suburbs, exactly what you'd see in the movies. And let me tell you, the house is much bigger
than it looks from the outside, many open and spacious rooms.

Our family consists of the parents, Chris and Anna, and their two kids, Greta and Smith. They have a
great sense of humor and are very welcoming, furthermore they have an awesome relationship with each
other, so no problems there. Anna always cooked for us in the evenings and made us lunch for our
high school days. She's a great cook, and in typical American fashion, every meal included some kind
of amazing meat.

On the weekend, they took us to a baseball game, which they paid the tickets for Max and me, which I
found very kind. They generally wanted to show us stuff that we don't have in Europe, which is very
thoughtful. On another day they took us to a typical American barbecue, where I ate the best ribs of
my life. I'm not even exaggerating, they were so good.

Overall, they were super nice and welcoming, and I'm very grateful to have been placed with them. I
hope that you'll have a similar opportunity someday in your life, living with a host family is lots
of fun.

Take care and talk to you soon!  
Jakob
