"What are you even talking about, I have had enough, I'm out!", you proclaim as you leave the dwarfs
be. But suddenly, you spot a cave entrance just a few meters away from you. "This looks promising",
you think as you enter the cave. It's dark, but you luckily always have a torch on your belt. You
light it up and start exploring.

You venture further into the cave, eventually reaching a big room. There, in the middle, you spot an
incredibly rare creature, a _Spider Duck_. One shouldn't be fooled by its trivial name, as these are
beings that have long existed before any other lifeforms. You can't believe your eyes. Not many
people have ever seen one, you are one of the lucky few. There are two options available to you, you
could either try to steal its eggs, incubating the artificially to eventually have your own
Spider Duck, or you could try to fight the creature, in order to gain its valuable feathers.

What will it be?
