Some call it the land of the free, others the land of opportunity. I call it the land of
_extravagant_ people. The sheer amount of crackheads, weirdos and people that didn't fit into any
category I could think of was astonishing. It was truly a sight to behold.

Anyways, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start from the beginning. We went on a two-week trip,
where we spent ten days in Washington or better said Virginia, while we spend the other 3 days in
New York City (I found this to be a bit unfair). New York City had been the city of my dreams since
I was a little kid, meaning that I was very excited to go there. However, I had no clue into what
I was getting myself into otherwise, but I was excited to see what the USA had to offer. (Boy,
did it offer a lot...)
