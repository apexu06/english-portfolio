description: 'A comment about my reading experience and presentation about Notes From A Big Country.'

I personally read the chapters _Spinning the truth_, _For your convenience_, _Old news_, _Sense of
humor failure_, _The accidental tourist_ and _What makes an Englishman_. It was an overall quite
enjoyable experience as the stories are written in a fun and light-hearted tone. While the author is
often writing in a petty style, complaining about little things one wouldn't even recognize in
their everyday lives, which can certainly get a bit stale and boring at some point, I wouldn't say
that it destroys the reading experience in any meaningful way.

For example, in _Spinning the truth_ and _For your convenience_ he talks about some everyday
annoyances which most of us have probably experienced at some point. He goes into great details
about those while an average person would think about those inconveniences for
approximately two seconds. Still, I think that, as said before, the stories remained fun and
entertaining, for me at least. Some of my classmates had a problem with the author trying to be too
funny, which is understandable, in my opinion.

However, in the end, I had fun reading through these short little stories, the presentation went
great too even though I basically freestyled it, which I'm very happy about.
