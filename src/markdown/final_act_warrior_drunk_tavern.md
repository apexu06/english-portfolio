---

You decide to stay at the tavern to have some more fun. As time passes, you can feel the alcohol
really kicking in. Your vision is blurry and starts to spin. Still, you are having a great time.
Then, in the evening your alcohol level is so high that you can't even talk properly anymore. Your
vision starts to fade and you pass out on the table.

A loud bang wakes you. You open your eyes to see a group of goblins wanting to raid the tavern full
of people. You don't feel as dizzy anymore, meaning that some time must have passed. Nevertheless,
you are still drunk and not really in a condition to fight. Do you stay to defend the tavern or do
you run away to save yourself?
