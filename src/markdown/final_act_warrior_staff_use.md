You decide to use the staff for yourself. While you're in the druids home, you look around for some
books on how to use the staff or magic in general. There are three books that look promising, one
about the basics of magic, the second one about the staff itself and a third one about advanced
druid sorcery. You put them all into your bag and venture home into the forest to your small hut.

Over the next few months, you study the books intensely, learning the basics of magic and how to
control the power the staff holds. It's not easy, there are many minor accidents along the way. You
almost set your hut on fire once but manage to extinguish it in time. You also decide to ignore the
ways of the druids, as those don't align with your goals. The sole goal of yours is to become a very
powerful wizard, one that can delete the druid from existence with the snap of a finger. 

The more time passes, the closer you get to your goal, eventually mastering the staff and its powers. 
You are now ready for your wizard adventures!
