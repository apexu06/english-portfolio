# Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio website. I put a lot of time, effort and (some) tears into this website, so
I hope that you won't encounter too many bugs. 

Here you should (hopefully) find all the tasks that were required in the portfolio requirements, if
I forgot any, well, skill issue on my end. I have structured the website so that its easy to
navigate, so that you, the reader, can enjoy their stay. You will also notice a function to comment 
below all posts, however that is reserved for some very important VIPs, so don't get your hopes up 
(except if you're the teacher, then you can leave as much feedback as you wish). 

This is my last portfolio in this school, which feels a bit weird, four years went by faster than
one DBI theory lecture (and this means something). Still, this was the most fun I had working on any
portfolio, especially the final act, where I maybe underestimated the effort required to make it
what it is now. But only maybe, I expected it of course (hope you have fun reading it).

Anyway, if you click the two magic words below, you will be taken to the category overview, so go
on, click it, maybe you will get a cookie or something.
