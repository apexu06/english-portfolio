On the last day of my trip to America, I decided that it was time to visit a bookstore, namely
_McNally Jackson Books_ near the _Rockefeller Center_. I really had no idea that this bookstore even
existed before I accidentally stumbled upon it while walking around the city. Without thinking too
much about it, I decided to go inside and take a look around.

That turned out to be a very good decision, as I instantly found a book that caught my eye: "The
Worlds of Dune" by _Tom Huddleston_. _Dune_ is one of my all-time favorite science fiction novels,
originally written by _Frank Herbert_, however this book claimed to dive deeper into the universe of
Dune and to explore Frank Herbert's motivations and inspirations for writing the novel. I didn't
even look around for other books, I just went with this one.

The book itself is a beautiful hardcover edition with some very nice cover art. However, it's not a
normal text book, some pages just consist of pictures and illustrations, all in very high quality,
which I found exceptionally well done. The quality of the paper is also very high, which makes for a
very nice reading experience. Regarding the content, it's very hard to describe this to a non-Dune
fan, however what I can say is that it brings forth an abundance of new information, insights and
details you probably wouldn't have noticed otherwise.

All that detail and information, combined with the superb quality and feel of the book itself, made
this a very special purchase for me. I'm very happy that I found this book and even though it was
expensive, I couldn't have spent my money in a better way.
