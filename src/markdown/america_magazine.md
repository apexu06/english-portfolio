Since Austria and America are two quite different countries, the food available in both countries
also differs a bit. However, if you think that you are going to get a lot of completely new food in
America, you might be mistaken and moreover, disappointed.

The first, stereotypical thing that comes to mind when thinking about American food is fast food.
This is not completely wrong, as you would find a lot of fast food restaurants, you wouldn't even
find in the whole of Europe. "Restaurants" like Taco Bell, Wendy's, or In-N-Out Burger are just a
few examples. In comparison to Austria where you would only find the most famous ones like
McDonald's, Burger King, Subway and KFC, America has a lot more to offer in this category.

Most of the restaurants themselves function quite similarly to those in Austria. One thing you might
notice is that there's a lot more self-service, which can be a bit annoying for some. Also, another
thing to note is that the portion sizes are generally speaking a lot bigger. Especially in Hard
Rock Caf√©s you get a lot for your money. So be careful not to order too much, you might not be able
to finish it.

Overall, food in America is quite similar to that in Austria. Nevertheless, you will find a lot more
fast food and portion sizes are much bigger. So if you're planning on going to America, keep that in
mind.
