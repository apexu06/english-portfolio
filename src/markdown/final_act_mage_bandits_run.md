You decide to make a run for your life. While starting to sprint, you even silently cast a spell
that makes you faster. The bandit seem a bit surprised about your speed, but they quickly start to
catch up. While you are faster than normal humans, you are certainly not faster than a horse, which
all the bandits seem to be riding. You can hear them getting closer and closer, the sound of the
galloping horses getting louder. Suddenly, you spot a thick embankment to your right, perfect for
getting away from the horse riders. You make a sharp right turn and sprint like you never have
before. With your stamina gone and the embankment just a few meters away, you make a final jump in
hopes of getting away. However, just as you are about to disappear in the bushes, you take an arrow
to the knee. The bandits come up to you, strip you of your goods and clothes, stab you in the chest
and leave you there to bleed out.

## You Died!
