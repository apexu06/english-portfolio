"Vi percutite, accensis!", you scream as you raise your staff. A bolt of lightning strikes reign
down from the ceiling of the cave, killing many mages. However, you didn't notice one important
detail - you are sitting in puddle of water. You watch in horror as one of the lightning bolts
strikes your puddle. You cannot even scream as you die instantly from the electric shock.

## You Died!
