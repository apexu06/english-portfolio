description: 'You chose to sell the druid staff for a significant amount of money.'
---

"This will be worth a lot on the right market.", you quietly say to yourself as you leave the
druid's home with staff in hand. You decide to head to the nearest city, which is only one hour away
by horseback. Once you arrive in the city gates, trying to conceal the staff as best you can. You enter a
dark alley, which is known for some shady deals. Finally, you find the auction house you were looking
for. There you present the staff to the auctioneer. The look in his eyes tells you that this staff is
worth a lot more than you initially thought.

After a few minutes of intense bidding, the staff is sold for 10000 gold coins. You can't believe
your luck as you leave the auction house with a lot of money in your bag. "This is more money than I
ever had in my life!", you think to yourself. You decide to spend the night in the city, celebrating
your success. The next day, you decide to leave the city and buy a nice mansion in the countryside,
with even a lake nearby. You live the rest of your days in luxury, never having to worry about money
ever again.
