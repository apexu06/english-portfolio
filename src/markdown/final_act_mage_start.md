Before you open your eyes, you can hear the wind howl past you. Itâ€™s no pleasant wind either, its
cold and harsh. Nonetheless, you slowly try to open your eyes, trying to avoid all the snow that is
blowing past you. You are blinded, not by the sun, but by the snow all around you. As you struggle
to stand up, you suddenly remember where you are and why you are here. You are on top of a mountain,
wanting to meet with the _secret wizard circle_. It's an important meeting, only happening every
five years when every powerful wizard in the land turns up to discuss their newest findings and
discoveries. However now that you think about it, you aren't sure if you still want to attend,
following some controversies over the last few meetings, namely some wizards losing their lives or
getting banished into the seventh layer of hell.
