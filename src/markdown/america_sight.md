On the 11th of September 2001, the world stood still. It started out like any other, however at 8:46
AM local time, a commercial airplane collided with the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New
York City. Not much later, a second plane hit the South Tower, eventually leading to the collapse of
both towers and the loss of many lives.

After all the rubble had been cleared, the site was turned into a memorial, honoring the people that
died that fateful day. It consists of two large pools where the towers once stood, both one acre in
size. These pools are surrounded by the names of all identified people that died that day,
which amounts to 2,983 names. The pools themselves possess large waterfalls (the largest man-made
waterfalls in America), which are also illuminated in the evening.

The memorial was a much bigger area than I had anticipated. It almost felt like a park, with people
slowly walking around, sitting below trees or just staring into the pools. The pools were
massive, to think that two towers once stood there was hard to imagine. Seeing that many names
etched into the metal plates surrounding the two pools was a rather sad sight. I have seen many
videos and images of the event itself, however being there in person gave me a feeling no video
could ever invoke.

9/11 was a very tragic event, one that should never be forgotten. The memorial does justice to honor
the all the people that died that day and gives a place for people to remember them. It is a sight
that is not forgotten very easily, which is not only due to its sheer size, but also due to its
unbelievable history.
