You take your place in the circle and wait for the arch mage to arrive. After a while, Gandalf
finally appears and the meeting officially starts. He steps in front of the large campfire, right
in the middle of all the others, including you. He raises his hands and starts to address you:
"First and Foremost, I would like to thank you all for coming here today. I called in this meeting,
because I have some important news to share with you. As you all know, all of you have something
called the _Behelith_. We only used it as a key for our secret places, but I have figured out its
deeper purpose!" He pauses for a moment, looking at all of you intensely. "The Behelith is not just
a key, it is a powerful artifact able to fuse with your staffs in order to unlock their full
potential. This includes the mystical _Dark Arts_, which were thought to be lost forever." A murmur
goes through the crowd, some are excited, others are skeptical. Gandalf continues: "I know this is
something ludicrous, but allow me to demonstrate." He lifts his staff and reveals that the top of
the staff has seemingly fused with the Behelith, now glowing in a deep red light. "_Circumscribere
lapsis_" he chants, and the campfire suddenly changes its color to a deep violet. All of you
stare in awe at the spectacle. "I will now teach you all how to fuse your Beheliths with your 
staffs. Just follow after me." You are not really sure what to think about all of this and if you
want to learn the _Dark Arts_, but you cannot design that you are intrigued by the possibilities.

What will you do?
