Well, that was something, dare I say. Way too much stuff happened in the last three days, but I'll
try to keep it short and sweet, so you don't have to read through a novel.

On Wednesday, we visited _Mount Vernon_, the estate of George Washington. I already found it
suspicious that Mt. Vernon was the sole destination for the day, but I assumed that there would be a
lot of stuff to do before we would do the "famous" mansion tour. I was wrong. We arrived at Mt.
Vernon at around 10 am, however the mansion tour wouldn't start until 2 pm. So, we had a lot of time
to kill. I spent most of my time with a girl from parallel class, we visited the _slave quarters_,
walked all around the estate, looked at everything there was to see but even that only took us about
one and a half hours. The rest was spent waiting around until the "amazing" tour started.

The tour is up there in the top 3 of the most boring tours I have done in my life. It only took
about 20 minutes, and we just looked at a house essentially. Still, Washington did have some very
fancy and colorful furniture.

After the tour, we waited for the bus to arrive, which basically concluded a quite uneventful
Wednesday.

With that letdown of a day behind us, Thursday seemed to be a bit more promising. We were split into
our classes, because one class would visit the _TeleControl_ company in the morning, while the other
would be at the _National Air and Space Museum_. After lunch, we would switch places.

My class or group started off by visiting the museum first, which made my face light up like when
I was a kid ten years ago. The sheer amount of planes, jets and other aircraft was just amazing.
However, it was topped by the _Space Shuttle Discovery_. The thing is massive, and it's just so cool
to see it up close after seeing it on TV so many times. They also had an abundance of different
atomic weapons, or at least replicas, still it was a bit jarring to see them up close.

Overall, the museum visit was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.

However, that high wouldn't last too long, as the company we visited afterwards was a major letdown
once again. In fact, I don't even really remember what it was about, but I do remember the boredom I
felt. They did some stuff regarding electronics but my memory of it is basically non-existent
already.

One disappointment later, we finished the day at some random mall, where we had about two hours of
free time. Was quite cool overall because I could try on the fancy _Apple Vision Pro_, which you
wouldn't even find in Europe. It was a pretty nice way to end Thursday.

Feeling satisfied with Thursday I was hopeful for today, and it honestly didn't disappoint. I had no
clue regarding what Alexandria and in extension the National Harbor would be like.

Alexandria itself was very pretty, I took a stroll along the water for an hour and a half before we
would go to the national harbor via a _water taxi_ (or just a ferry). While I didn't really do
anything in Alexandria except walking around, I still enjoyed it as it was very relaxing. After two
hours there, we took the fancy water taxi towards the National Harbor, which took about 15 minutes.

Describing the National Harbor is a bit hard for me as it was a very nice looking place, but
everything seemed kind of "fake". It felt like I was in a mixture of L.A. and a tiny version of
Vegas, really hard to describe. There were lots of restaurants however not many people were walking
around, it just seemed like a place build from nothing only for tourists. It even had its own ferry
wheel. Despite all this, I enjoyed exploring the place and I had some very nice pasta at an Italian
restaurant. But the day had one more surprise...

And that amazing surprise was the _Austrian Embassy_. Everyone was quite confused of what we were
supposed to do there, me included. We were greeted by a fellow Austrian who then held a lecture
about how the embassy system works in America, explaining not only the Austrian embassy but also the
Italian one for example. Again, I can't really say too much about the contents because I was so
tired at that point that I don't even really remember what the guy was talking about.

This marks the end of my adventures in Washington, meaning that the next stop will be New York City
(I'm very excited).
