Overall, the final act was probably the most fun I had during the whole project. I always liked text
adventures, so this seemed like the obvious choice for me. I don't know if it's very meaningful, as
it's a fantasy story, with some _shitposty_ elements here and there, but I still think that it's fun
to read. However, I must warn those that want to do this themselves, it's a lot of work. I very much
underestimated this at first and thought that I was going to write like 4000-5000 words in total, 
but now it's more than double that. Nevertheless, writing all of it improved my writing _speed_ the
most I think, because after some time, I was able to write much more in the same time frame as I did
before. 

Also, I sure could have done a better job at planning the whole thing, but I didn't, which 
was my fault, but it still worked out, although it was a bit stressful towards the end. Finally, I 
could surely have a deep and probably meaningful conversation with someone who read the whole thing, 
however if the other person didn't read it, it's going to be more of a one-sided conversation.
