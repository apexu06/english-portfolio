description: 'You chose to investigate the weird scream coming from the forest.'

"This could be interesting, so why not?", you think to yourself. You start to walk into the
direction of the initial scream, trying to watch your step as you go. The forest is dense, with many
bushes, trees, rocks and roots in your way. Nevertheless, you manage to get closer, signalled by
more screams, which turn out to be a heated argument between two parties. Slowly, you try to get
closer and closer, until you can see the two parties arguing, which turn out to be two dwarfs.
"Maybe a couple, but what are they doing out here?", you think, as you hide in order to not be seen.
It seems like a very heated discussion, with both of them pointing fingers at each other. You can't
help it, but you want to know more about what's going on. 

Do you ask them what's going on or do you stay in your current position and listen?
