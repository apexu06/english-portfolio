description: 'You decided to use the orb to return back to your world.'

You wake up in the initial wizard meeting cave where your journey began. You look around and see all
other wizards looking at you. "What have you done?", a deep voice asks. You look to your left and
see the arch mage staring into your soul. "I... I don't know", you stutter. "You have used the orb in
some way, haven't you?", the arch mage asks. "This orb is an old relic of times long past. It has
been given to us by a greater deity with its only command being: _No mortal shall ever enable the
powers of this orb._ You have broken the rules of this world and now you have to face the
consequences." "This is bad", you think. You have two options: explain yourself or run away with
the orb.
