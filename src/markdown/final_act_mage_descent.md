In the wake of what happened at past meetings you decide that it's not worth it. You turn around as
you want to start your descent. But there is a minor inconvenience: How do you get down? Of course,
there's the option of walking down, taking the beaten path, but that would take quite a while. The
other approach would be to use a new spell called **No Gravity**. It's a spell that allows the
user to control the effect that gravity has on them. However, it's a spell that is hard to control,
also if one loses control in high altitudes, the consequences could cost one's life. Furthermore,
you have only used this spell once before, to say you have mastered it, would be a lie. Nonetheless,
it would be much, much faster than normal walking. Considering that this would be a perfect time to
hone your skills, you decide to use the spell.

You walk up to the edge of a cliff, hold up your staff and proclaim: _gravitas non abiit!_ A purple
glow starts to emit from the top of your staff, signaling that your spell casting was successful.
You can your feel your body getting lighter and lighter, until you feel like a feather. "Let's do
this carefully", you think to yourself. You take a step forward and fall down.

If you had to guess, a fall with normal gravity would take about 30 seconds, a fall lethal enough
for basically every living being. But now you are in control, dropping like a feather in the wind,
slow and controlled. You can see the snow-covered trees and rocks pass by you, but you must not
break your concentration, or you will have a premium ticket to your god. It all goes well until you are
about halfway down, where suddenly a bird comes out of nowhere and crashes right into your left arm,
causing you to flinch, breaking the spell.

You are now in normal free fall, you have about 15 seconds before you meet your creator. Two ideas
pop into your head almost instantly. You could either, cast **Featherfall** which would be enough in
this height to save your life. On the other hand you could cast **Fireball**, a spell your master 
once taught you, which can be helpful in every situation.

Decide quickly!
