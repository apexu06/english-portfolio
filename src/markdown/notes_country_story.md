Imagine the following situation, you just selected your wanted wares at the supermarket and now you
want to pay. You go to the checkout and see a long queue, because the supermarket doesn't want to
open another checkout. "Great", you think to yourself as you get in line and prepare for a long
waiting period. While waiting you check to see if you have enough money in your wallet and if you
do, you prepare some roughly matching bills for the things you want to buy, so that the payment
process is done more quickly However, there is an older person in front of you, completely oblivious
to the fact that they are about to pay and once the cashier tells them the amount of money to pay,
they get out their wallet and slowly start searching for their money. This process often takes
millions of years, at least that's what it feels like when you are waiting behind those scrambling
for their wallet, money in hand and ready to pay.

Of course, I could be completely wrong, meaning that I'm the solemn person on this planet
that had to live through this, which I greatly doubt. This has been an annoyance of mine since I
understood the basic principle of money, which I did when I was like five or six years old. All the
way back since then, I have always prepared money when approaching the checkout in basically any
store, as it just makes the life of the cashier and everyone else easier, that's my opinion at
least. Furthermore, I also observed that the older the person searching for their money is, the
longer it takes, which kind of makes sense. However, this leads to more problems as older people
(I'm talking of pensioners here) are often in less of a hurry and take their time, which is mostly
no problem in of itself, but it still annoys the hell out of me when their behavior affects other
people that don't have as much time.

It has to be noted that while I only complained about older people here, everyone from every age
group can make this grave mistake and anger the whole queue. This however, does not invalidate the
fact that its such easy thing to avoid if the people would just use the pink, average sized blob in
their head called the _brain_.
