You decide to stay sober, knowing that a potential battle may be coming up. You enjoy some more time
in the tavern, talking to the others and listening to the bard's music. Then, suddenly you are asked
to join a hunt for some _stalkers_, big, slender creatures that can turn invisible and have scythes
instead of hands. Thinking that you have sat in the tavern long enough, you agree to join the hunt.

You and the others approach the location where the stalkers were supposedly seen via horseback. You
know that stalkers aren't something to be taken lightly, but you are confident of your victory as a
group. As you dismount your horse, you can see four stalkers in the distance, slightly hovering
above the ground. You draw your sword and prepare for the fight. One archer takes the initiative and 
cleanly shoots the first one in the head, killing it. Your plan is to sneakily approach one, while
they are distracted trying to find out where the arrow came from. You manage to close in on one of
the stalkers looking around, a bit separated from the others. "Perfect", you think to yourself. The
stalker doesn't have time to react as you swing your sword and cut off its head in one clean strike.
It instantly dissolves into nothingness, as stalkers always do. Your mates have taken care of one
other stalker, now only one remaining. You charge it head first, however the mage is faster than
you, casts a fireball and incinerates the last stalker.

The hunt is over, a perfect ambush, executed flawlessly. You loot a new breastplate from the remains
of the stalkers, as they sometimes leave behind valuable goods. "Not bad for a day's work", you say
to yourself, satisfied with the outcome. Your mates have already mounted their horses and started
the ride back towards the tavern. However, just as you want to follow them, you hear a rather
high-pitched scream coming from deeper within in the forest.

Do you want to investigate?
