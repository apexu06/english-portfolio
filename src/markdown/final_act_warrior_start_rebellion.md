You have had enough of the druid and his plans. You decide that something must be done to stop him.
As you begin to convince the others that the druid's plan is insane, you notice how most of them
agree with very easily, much in your favor. After some time has passed, all the halflings know of
the plan to stop the druid in his tracks, with the only problem being that the druid isn't allowed
to notice anything.

The plan is simple, once the druid shows up again, you will try to overpower him in a surprise
attack. Because all of your equipment has been taken from you, it will be a fight with bare hands
against a druid capable of magic. A silly plan, but one that might just work. As the druid finally
arrives to probably give you another speech, a feral roar goes through the hall as 300+ halflings
charge the single druid. 

The druid is taken by surprise and gets tackled to the ground, but frees himself almost instantly as
he casts a powerful wind spell, launching about 10 halflings into the air. You can't even do much
because there are way too many halflings in the way, you can barely see what the druid is doing.
Despite this, you decide to push through towards the druid. Suddenly, the hall lights up in a bright
light, blinding you for a few seconds. As you open your eyes again, about 100 halflings lost their
lives, the druid apparently cast a powerful lighting spell. You look into your comrades faces and see
despair and fear, they are on the verge of running away. "Time to take matters into my own hands",
you think as you scream and charge the druid, trying to get the other scared halflings to follow you.
The druid notices you and prepare to cast a fireball, however another halfling jumps him from the
side knocking the druid to the ground. You take the opportunity, run towards him and jump onto him
with your full weight. The druid gasps for air but gets kicked in the head by another halfling,
rendering him unconscious.

The hall is silent, the druid lying on the ground, defeated. The fight cost about 150 halflings
their lives, but you managed to come out victorious. You look around, the others displaying mixed
feelings, some happiness, some sadness, other despair. You have no idea what will happen next, if
you can reverse your transformation to become a normal-sized human once again and if you can ever
live a normal life again. At the end of the day, you have fought for your freedom and the freedom of
others, laying the footwork for a normal future, something to be proud of.
