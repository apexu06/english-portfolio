We arrived on Wednesday, the 17th of April, at Washington Dulles Airport. The flight was long, all
of us were tired, however I was very excited to meet my host family. They were very kind people the
first time me and my friend met them, more about them later. We went on to drive to their house,
were we unloaded our baggage, talked a lot and went to bed. It was time for school the next day.

The American high school experience was truly something to behold. There were so many students and
all the hallways looked the same. It was like a maze, without our host student, Greta, we would
have been completely lost. The classes were interesting, but the students were more interested in
us. They asked us a lot of questions about our country, which was fun to answer. We also showed them
Euros and other stuff like that. However, just after two days, our high school career was over.

The weekend was spent with our host family. They took us to a massive baseball game in Washington
DC, which was much interesting than I had anticipated. There were so many people, the weather was
perfect and the game itself had a very exciting ending ("our" guys won in the end).

What I don't miss is the constant smell of weed literally everywhere, it was very annoying.

After that, we visited Bull Run, a battlefield famous for being the site of the first major battle
of the American Civil War. It doesn't look much like a battlefield today, its more of just a big,
grassy field. We took a guided tour, which showed us some landmarks of the battle, like the exact
spots and locations where the Union and Confederate soldiers began their fight. There was also a
musket shooting demonstration, where I severely underestimated the noise of the guns, it was very
loud.

Nevertheless, our family also took us to _Luray Caverns_, which was a very cool looking cave filled
with stalactites and stalagmites. It was a guided tour, but the guide turned out to be a funny guy,
meaning that the tour was quite enjoyable.

Overall, the first week (Wednesday to Sunday) was very interesting and also a bit shocking, but not
in a bad way. America is just very different when compared to a small country like Austria. Hell,
even Virginia is bigger than Austria alone. I'm looking forward to the next week, where we will
spend a lot of time in Washington DC and finally, New York City.
