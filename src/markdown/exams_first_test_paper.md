## Correction

### Part III
#### Task A
- Hi Jack, I'm writing you to answer **the** questions you had about my work in a ski resort last
  winter.
- I think the best aspect of working there was that I pretty much met new and interesting people
  every day, seven days of the week, mostly the in **apr√®s-ski** bar.
- **All the best**, Jakob

#### Task B
- While it is the most basic **strategy**, teaching young people actual practical skills is a very 
  smart thing to do.
- More often than not, the practical part is much more important in the average work life, with
  there **being only** a few exceptions.
- Therefore, it is important for **the students** to experience more of the practical part, rather 
  than the theoretical one, as it helps them gain very valuable skills for their future work 
  **lives**.
- Nevertheless, gaining information about the possibilities and **specifics** of many different jobs
  is almost as important.
