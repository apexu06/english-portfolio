As I expected I didn't have much trouble overall, but I still found the reading / use of English 
to be harder than the listening as I mostly do. However, I think that the listening was a bit easier 
this time as I could directly hear it through my headphones rather than some speakers in a bigger 
room. These reading tasks were quite easy for me personally except maybe for the last one, as that 
one took me a bit longer to finish.

Overall though, my biggest problems still lie within the use of English parts, as those can be very
tricky, especially part 4 in this case, where you have to complete a similar sentence with a word
given. It's very useful to possess a broad vocabulary in these types of tasks as you can think of 
more strategies to build the sentences. Still, I think I did quite well in this practice exam, 
which I'm happy about.
