You shake your head, "No, thank you, I'm fine. 'Tis but a scratch." The druid looks at you with a
confused expression, then shrugs and puts the vial back. "As you wish. You can stay here until you
are fully healed then.", he says, leaving the room. You are left alone with your thoughts, but you
decide to close your eyes to get some rest.

After two days, while always being visited by the druid to check on you, to give you food and to
suspiciously ask if you changed your mind about the potion, you decide to leave as your wounds have
healed sufficiently. You thank the druid for his hospitality, however as you are about to leave, you
turn around to see the druid charging at you with some sort of syringe in his hand. He's closing in 
rapidly so decide quickly:

- [Kick the druid](final_act_warrior_druid_kick)
