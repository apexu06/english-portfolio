## Facilities that should receive funding

Today, there are many facilities in our modern society in need of funding. However, money is not
unlimited, which means that certain choices have to be made about which facilities should receive
funding. This essay aims to provide an answer to this question.

Museum bear a large portion of our history and culture. They are very important for preserving
important artifacts, documents and events that happened in the past. While it may be true that not
everyone is interested in history, it is still a must to pass knowledge of our past to future
generations. This is easily done by building and maintaining museums as these are the most efficient
places to learn about our history. 

On the other hand, sport facilities are important for the health of every human. While museums offer
more of a view into the past, sport facilities can help people in the present, which one could
argue, is more important. Many people are living unhealthy lives today, as they do not possess the
money to spend on expensive sport equipment or memberships. By funding these facilities, it will be
easier for everyone to live a healthier life, which in turn will produce a healthier society.

Overall, museums and sport facilities are both important for different reasons. However, in the end
the current health of the people should be a priority, rather than the history of the past. This
does not mean that museums have no reason to exist, but rather that the health of the people should
be prioritized when it comes to funding.
