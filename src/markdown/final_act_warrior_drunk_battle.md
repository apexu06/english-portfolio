You agree to join the battle. The others cheer, all ready for the upcoming fight. You slowly stand 
up, the room spinning around you. Everyone grabs their respective weapons, with you almost managing 
to drop your sword. "This won't end well..." you think to yourself. The door opens and you all step 
out and onto your horses. It's noon, the sun shining brightly and slightly blinding you. 
Nevertheless, you find your old, trusty horse and promptly mount it without any trouble. "Maybe I'm 
not that drunk." you mumble silently. Your companions don't seem to notice your battle with alcohol
and instead focus on the upcoming fight. The enemy this time are _stalkers_, big, slender creatures
that can turn invisible and have scythes instead of hands. Frightening creatures, really. You have
fought and defeated stalkers before, but with a clear head. "I'll just trust my friends, they'll
manage to keep me alive." you think as you start to ride towards the location where the stalkers
were supposedly seen.

It's a wonder that you manage to stay on your horse, albeit with some major difficulties. The longer
you ride, the funnier the situation seems to you. You let out a little laugh, but is enough for the
others to hear you through the wind. "What's so funny?" one of them asks. "Just thinking about how
easy this is going to be." you answer, in a very drunk state. "Haha! You are truly ready for 
battle!" he laughs back. With your confidence boosted by your friend's words, you ride on, now close
to the stalker location. You almost fall off your horse as you try to dismount, but manage to stay
on your feet. While the others have already started to cautiously approach the area, you struggle to
draw your sword. After a few tries, you manage to get it out of its sheath and follow your friends.

You see the stalkers, three of them, slightly hovering above the ground in the distance. The archers
and mages of your group start attacking from the distance while the sword fighters, including you,
charge the beasts. However, your fight doesn't last long. You are too drunk to fight properly
resulting in you tripping over a rock and falling flat on your stomach right in front of a stalker.
Your vision goes black as you feel a sharp pain in your back. The sounds of your friends fighting
fade away as you lose consciousness. 

You wake up in some sort of bed, your head pounding and your chest aching with excruciating pain. As
you open your eyes, you see a blurry figure standing in front of you. He looks like a typical druid,
going off of his green robe and wooden staff. "Drink this potion, it will help you recover. You were
almost pierced through your heart." he says, holding a small vial with some red liquid in it. While
your brain is still trying to comprehend what's going on, you remember that one of the most
important rules of living in this land is to never accept drinks from strangers, especially potions.
Although, this magic potion could still be perfect for your recovery, considering the situation you
are in. Furthermore, what evil intent could a druid which took care of you possibly have?
