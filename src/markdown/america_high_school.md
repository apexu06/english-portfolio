The first thing I noticed when going to _Westfield High School_ was that the school had its own
buses. On both days, I got there in one of many, many buses. The next thing I noticed was that all
students exit the buses at the same time which doesn't make too much sense for me, as it creates a
lot of chaos. However, once I got inside the school, I was even more overwhelmed.

The school was huge! It was like a maze, with hallways going in all directions. Because students
don't have a fixed classroom for each subject, after each lesson, everyone has to go to their
respective classrooms, which creates a lot of traffic in the hallways. On the one hand, I thought
that it was a tiny bit annoying, but on the other hand, it does create a sense of variety. You are
never sitting in the same room for like 6 hours straight, which is a nice change.

One lesson I very much enjoyed was the history lesson. First off, the teacher was a very cool guy
even though the other students I met there said that he was scary. I didn't see that at all. A
debate was planned for that day, I didn't know what it was about, but I was excited. There were
about 20â€“30 students, each of them taking the role of an important leader during the times of the
Cold War, like Reagan, Winston Churchill or Stalin. The question the teacher then asked was: "Do you
think that small countries developed faster or profited from the Cold War in general?" Sounds like a
boring question at first, however all the others were so engaged in the debate, which made it
very fun. After some time the teacher even asked us silently if we (me and my friend) wanted to join
in instead of just watching. We did, and we were assigned Kim Il-Sung and Mao Zedong respectively.
Of course, both of us didn't have much of a clue about what they did, so we just improvised. At the
end I was laughing tears, the best history lesson I ever had.

One final thing I found was the diversity of the students. There was almost a 50/50 split between
white and black students, but there were also a lot of Asians, which you just wouldn't see in a
school in Austria. A very cool thing to see. Of course, all the students were very friendly and
interested in us, because many of them only had a very vague idea of Europe in general. I was asked
to show them Euros, show them our passports, credit cards, driver's licenses and so on. It was very
interesting to see how they reacted to all of that. High school would have been a lot more boring
without all of them.

I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have visited _Westfield High School_, it was a lot more fun
than I thought it would be. Maybe I'll get a similar opportunity in the future, who knows, I'd
certainly welcome it.
