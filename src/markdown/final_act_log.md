### 24.03.2024
Today I started with the overall structure of my final act (a bit late, I know). I sat down and 
really though about what I should do, resulting in the idea of a text adventure. After the idea was
set in stone, I started with the warrior path by drawing it in a sort of _tree_ structure in 
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). Once I was happy with it, I started to write the first few
texts, like the starting point where you choose your path and the first _branch_ of the warrior
tree. All of this took about 2–3 hours.

### 27.03.2024
I only had little time today, meaning that I only wrote the "Drink the potion" part. It wasn't too
much work, but still important because it was an important plot point. Overall work time: 30 minutes
to one hour.

### 29.03.2024
Today I finished a big portion of the warrior path. I finished the whole druid story, including all
decisions and outcomes. There is also an AI generated image for every ending now, which adds a nice
flair I think. I'm currently sitting at about ~3800 words, which is a lot more than I imagined, but
I'm not complaining. Some real progress was made today, I'm happy with it, even though it took me
like 5 hours to write all of it.

### 30.03.2024
Finished up the drunk warrior branch today, the part where you stay in the tavern was the last 
piece missing. It was a lot of fun to write, but it wasn't too much work. I wrote for about 40 
minutes today, but its still good progress.

### 31.03.2024
A lot of work was done today, finishing the complete warrior path, which I'm very proud of. The
whole warrior path is now about 23 texts long, with 9 different endings and a total of about ~6700
words. Very satisfied overall, but also quite tired, I worked for about 4–5 hours today. Tomorrow
I'll start with the mage path, but I don't know if I'll make it as expansive as the warrior path.

### 01.04.2024
Drew the whole mage tree today, which is not as big as the warrior is, but it should still be a fun
read. I didn't write any text today, but it still took me like 1-2 hours to think of a story and
draw it in Excalidraw.
