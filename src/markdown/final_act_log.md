### 24.03.2024
Today I started with the overall structure of my final act (a bit late, I know). I sat down and 
really though about what I should do, resulting in the idea of a text adventure. After the idea was
set in stone, I started with the warrior path by drawing it in a sort of _tree_ structure in 
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). Once I was happy with it, I started to write the first few
texts, like the starting point where you choose your path and the first _branch_ of the warrior
tree. All of this took about 2â€“3 hours.

### 27.03.2024
I only had little time today, meaning that I only wrote the "Drink the potion" part. It wasn't too
much work, but still important because it was an important plot point. Overall work time: 30 minutes
to one hour.

### 29.03.2024
Today I finished a big portion of the warrior path. I finished the whole druid story, including all
decisions and outcomes. There is also an AI generated image for every ending now, which adds a nice
flair I think. I'm currently sitting at about ~2800 words, which is a lot more than I imagined, but
I'm not complaining. Some real progress was made today, I'm happy with it, even though it took me
like 5 hours to write all of it.
