description: 'You chose to refuse the dark arts from the arch mage.'

You decide that this is not for you. While all the others are busy fusing their Beheliths with
their staffs, you try to sneak out of the cave. But just as you are about to move away, the arch
mage notices you. "Where do you think you are going?", he asks. You try to come up with an excuse,
but no words stumble out of your mouth. All the other, now corrupted mages, turn towards you. Their
glowing violet eyes pierce through you. The arch mage casts **Windus Repellus** which hits you right
in the stomach and sends you flying. You crash into the wall and fall to the ground. The others
slowly approach in a threatening half-circle. "You are a coward to refuse such power", the all utter
in seemingly the same voice. They all hold their staffs up, preparing to cast a mighty group spell.
This could be your end. You'll have to decide fast.
