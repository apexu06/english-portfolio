description: 'Overall feedback about my english learning progress since I started this school.'

Since the last four years my English speaking and writing skills have improved a lot. I was
basically able to understand any "normal" English conversation before however I really couldn't take
part effectively. This has improved drastically since, however I'm still not very satisfied with my
speaking skills. Some words still give me trouble to pronounce, the worst offender being 
"situation", nevertheless I think I'm on a good path to improve this as well. Despite this, I think
that my writing skills have improved drastically. Since I was young, I always had little trouble 
writing long texts in German, and now it's not much different in English. I'm able to express myself 
in a way that is much more detailed and intricate than before, at least when I'm writing. 

One of my strongest areas is reading, as I've always enjoyed reading books. I was 12 years old when
I read my first, albeit short, English book. Ever since then I have amassed a collection of English 
books I've read, and I think that reading all those books has given me a quite broad vocabulary.
This in turn has probably helped with my writing skills as well. Lastly, my listening skills are
probably the best when comparing them to the others. Pretty much 90% of all media I consume is in
English at this point, my Twitter or Instagram feeds are good examples. Furthermore, it has almost 
become a rarity that I watch a movie or YouTube video in German.

Overall, I'm quite happy with my current English skills, but I still want to improve my speaking as
that is the most important part of a language, that's my opinion at least.
