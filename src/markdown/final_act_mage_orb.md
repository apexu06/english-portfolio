You give into the temptation and walk towards the orb. It illuminates your face in a cyan hue as you
lean over it. You can feel the orb vibrating a little bit when you touch it. "Strange", you think as
you inspect it closer. The surface is smooth and cold, yet the orb seems to be pulsating with 
energy. This energy could also be the reason as to why you feel so drawn to it. You look around, but
no one else seems to notice your escapades with the orb. The orb is surprisingly light, and you can
easily lift it up, however it's a bit hard to hold as it's quite large. Weight and size don't really
seem to make sense. While holding it in both hands, you can feel the energy flowing through you much
faster than before. 

Suddenly, both your hands simultaneously _sink_ into the orb, as if it was made out of water. You 
try to get the more out, but your body only gets sucked in further. You want to scream for help once 
you are shoulder deep in the orb, but it's too late. Your journey into the orb has begun.

As you open your eyes again, you find yourself in the middle of a battlefield. However, it's no
battlefield you have ever seen before. The sky is a dark red, the ground is covered in dead bodies
and around people are charging each other with short swords attached to some sort of wooden stick.
As you turn around, you see another ones wooden stick explode in a bright light, killing the person
in front of him. They all scream words you don't understand, also everywhere you look you see people
waving a flag, which consists of three vertical stripes, one blue, one white and one red, from left
to right. You have never seen it before, but as you inspect your surroundings further, you notice
that you are in front of some castle, seemingly on the attacking side. Looking down at your hands,
you notice that the orb is still there, just as large, light and glowy as before. "Maybe I can use
this to get out of here", you think to yourself. You flinch as a big explosion goes off ten meters 
to the right of you. Quickly, you run away to some cover next to some barracks in order to 
concentrate on your next move. Once you do, you notice that you have two options: You can either try 
to use the orb again to get out of this battle, or you can join the fight. What will you do?
