Thinking that the kingdom needs some sort of change, you decide to join the druid on his mission.
This reality also seems to set in for the other Halflings, as they all begin to calm down and
prepare for the big upcoming day. 

Over the following weeks, you train with the other Halflings, with you becoming a pretty skilled 
archer. The druid doesn't show himself too much, he is occupied with setting up a solid plan,
because storming the kings castle head on is essentially suicide. But then finally, after three
months, he reveals his grand plan to all of you. His plan is as follows:

1. 10-20 Halflings should infiltrate the kings castle one day before the big attack
2. Once the druid gives his signal these start to eliminate as many knights as possible inside
3. You and the other Halflings then begin to storm the castle (and the city beforehand) from all
   side, your goal is to overwhelm the outer defenses
4. If all went well, the druid should be in control of the castle with you as his direct servant

After another three days, the plan is set into action and 13 of your colleagues are set to
infiltrate the kings castle. This seems to happen without major problems, as on the next day, the
druid gives you the command to attack. It will be a big battle, but as you draw your bow and step
into the sun, you are filled with determination. All of you scream in unison as you charge and your
fight for a better tomorrow begins.
