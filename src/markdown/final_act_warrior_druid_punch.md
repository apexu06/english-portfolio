description: 'You chose to punch the druid, who tried to inject you.'

You punch the druid right into his face, a clean right hook. He instantly goes down, the syringe 
flying out of his hand. "What was that for?", you ask yourself as look at the unconscious druid on
the ground. Your fist hurts a bit, but you can't help but feel a bit proud of yourself. You inspect
the druid more closely and find his staff. Druid staffs are known to be of great worth and power,
only given to a small circle of individuals. "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity!", you think,
as you grab the staff. It feels warm in your hand, with the top of it glowing in a slightly orange
hue. You can almost feel the power flowing through it. There are two options now, you can either use
the staff and its magical powers for yourself or you can sell it on the black market for a ludicrous
amount of money.
