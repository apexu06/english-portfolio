"Well you don't look so bad yourself, I must say", you answer her with a grin. Her husband is now in
complete disbelief, his mouth wide open, unable to add anything to the conversation. "By the way, my
name is _Korilla_, and my former husband at this point here is _Wulbren_. Anyway, let's not waste
any time and exit this forest, shall we?", she says as she determinately grabs your arm.
You nod and start to walk back to your horse, with Korilla in tow. Wulbren is still standing there,
rooted in place, still not able to move or say anything. 

Then, in a turn of events no one could have predicted, Korilla is crushed by a big branch, which 
must have seemingly fallen from an old tree. She dies instantly. You somehow managed to dodge it,
with the only remaining part of Korilla being her hand, which is still holding your arm and
detached from what used to be her body. In disgust and shock, you grab the hand and throw it in a
random direction, but just as luck would have it, the hand flies towards Wulbran and slaps him right
in the face. A slap from the afterlife, one could say. You are a big mix of emotions, from shock to
disgust to a slight hint amusement. Who would have guessed that a simple stalker hunt could end like
this?

You almost forgot about Wulbren, but as you look towards him, you can see the thousand-yard stare in
his now empty eyes. "I... I... I...", he stutters, but can't finish his sentence. You decide that 
it's best to leave him be, as he seemingly still had some feelings for Korilla, despite their heated
disputes. As you leave the forest and mount your horse, you think about all the things that have 
happened to you today. "What a crazy day", you think to yourself, as you make your way back to your 
home.

The moment you get home you just want to lie down and sleep. You are exhausted from your eventful
day. You lay down in your bed, close your eyes and drift off to sleep, dreaming of some magical
adventures you never had. However, there seems to be some sort of intruder in your house. A small
figure emerges from the shadows of your rooms, climbs upon your bed and wakes you. "Oh, you are
finally awake, any last words?", the figure says. You can't make out who it is, but as your eyes
focus you recognize it, someone you had just met earlier today. "What in the seven hells, WULBREN? 
What are you doing?", you gasp. "Just taking back what you took from me!", he shouts as he rams his
daggers into your chest. In your last moments, you let out a chuckle and think to yourself: "What a
shitty way to go."
