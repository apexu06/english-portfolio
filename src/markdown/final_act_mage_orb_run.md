You decide that talking is not going to help you in this situation. With the orb in hand you turn
around and sprint towards the cave exit. You almost reach it, however just before you can leave you
are lifted off the ground by an invisible force. The arch mage has you in his grip and without a
word you are transported out of the cave into the cold day. "Your punishment will be your owns loss
of life", the arch mage says before lifting you over the cliff. "If you have any last words, you
shall say them now." You look down into the white abyss below you. "You are a traitor and a
coward", you say. Just as the arch mage drops you, you reveal the orb from your pocket, fuse with it
and vanish into thin air. The arch mage is left standing there, his face filled with anger and rage.

You however are nowhere to be found.
