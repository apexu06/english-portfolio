"This man is lying, I have done nothing wrong!", you proclaim with a loud voice. "This orb showed me
new worlds we never even dreamt of! I saw vast deserts, old temples and cities with people
overflowing the streets. I have seen things that no one else has ever seen before. And you, Gandalf
kept this away from us by telling us that this orb is dangerous. But it's far from dangerous, it's a
key to new worlds!" Many of the other wizards nod in agreement, but the arch mage just looks at you
his eyes filled with anger. "What made you spout such nonsense?", he asks angrily. "Why don't you
back up your claims and show us some proof?" You look around with a triumphant smile as you take out
the French flag you took from the battlefield. "This is the flag of a country I was in. It's called
France and I happened to visit amidst a revolution. People were fighting for their freedom and
lives." You let the flag float in the air and the other wizards gasp in awe. "This is not possible",
the arch mage says. "You must have gotten this piece of cloth from somewhere else. This is not 
proof!" It seems like the other wizards have lost all trust in the arch mage, they are too stunned by
the stories you tell them. "I have seen things you wouldn't believe", you continue. "I have seen
things that would make you question your own existence. I have seen things that would make you want
to leave this world behind and never look back. And I have seen things that would make you want to
return to your own world and never leave it again. But together we can use this power to travel this
orb as a group and explore the different worlds together!" The wizards start to cheer, while the
arch mage just looks at you with a red face. "This isn't over!", he says and vanishes in a puff of
thin air.

Soon after you are hailed as the new arch mage and the orb is now in your possession. You have
mastered the orb and can now travel to different worlds at will. For you have become the strongest
wizard in the realm.
