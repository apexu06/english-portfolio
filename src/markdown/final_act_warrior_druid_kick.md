You kick him with all your might. The kick lands perfectly, right into his stomach, however you can
feel your left foot slipping on the ground. You lose your balance and begin to stumble backwards,
tumbling right towards the druid's cauldron. The cauldron is filled with an almost glowing green
liquid, something you definitely don't want to be in contact with. You flail your arms around,
trying to grab onto something, but it's too late, you fall backwards into the cauldron. The liquid
feels like warm water, which is a relief, but only for a moment. Suddenly, your body starts to feel a
bit awkward, you try to get out of the liquid, but you can't control your limbs. You don't know
what's happening, you're just in some sort of trance, while still submerged in the liquid. Your
body starts to transform, your skin grows fur, your hands turn into paws, your nose changes into
a snout. You have successfully turned into a cat! 

The druid takes you out of the cauldron, holding you in his hands. "Ha! Look what we have here!", he
says in a rather amused tone. "What happened to me?", you try to scream, however only a soft "Meow"
comes out of your mouth. The druid laughs, "You have been turned into a cat, my friend. You will be
my personal assistant from now on." You try to scratch him, but you can't control your body
properly. As soon as he puts you on the ground, you try to run as fast as a cat can, but you aren't
able to properly control your new body. The druid picks you up again, "Oh no, you won't escape this
house, I have erected a magical barrier just for you." You realize that you are stuck with the
druid, as his personal assistant, at least for the foreseeable future.
