You slowly approach the nest, trying to make as little noise as possible. The Spider Duck is on the
other side of the room, seemingly occupied with something else. "This is my chance", you think to
yourself. You reach the nest, see the eggs and take as many as you can carry. Just as you want to
turn around the Spider Duck notices you. It lets out a loud screech, it echoes through the cave.
With no other option, you make a run for it, careful not to drop the eggs. The Spider Duck is fast,
but you manage to get out of the cave and back into the forest. You instantly jump into a bush in
order to hide. The Spider Duck comes out of the cave and scans its surroundings. However, it doesn't
find you and just lets out another loud screech. You wait for a few more minutes, until you're sure
that you're safe. It's finally time to get back to your horse and ride back home.

Back home, over the following weeks, you start to incubate the eggs. There are about a dozen of
them, which will all become big and powerful Spider Ducks. You can't wait for them to hatch, to
finally have your own mystical Spider Duck army. Eventually the day comes, they all hatch. From that
day on, you spend all of your time training them, feeding them and taking care of the little Spider
Ducks. All that lifeforms that know you from that point on call you the **Spider Duck Master**.
