It seems logical to you in your final seconds, casting **Featherfall** to slow your fall. You start
to mumble the words: *Pluma me citius*, but it has no effect. The ground coming ever closer, you try
to cast it again, again nothing happens. You say it three more times, before your body makes
unpleasant contact with the rocky ground below you. You don't survive.

It turns out, you cast the spell **Feather, accelerate me**, which only made your descent faster.
Better luck next time.

## You Died!
