All good things come to an end and so did this very special trip. I would have stayed longer if I
could have, but I had to return to my normal life. I'm very grateful for this probably once in a
lifetime opportunity to visit America with all my close friends.

Starting with my host family, they were honestly such nice people. Even though I was a bit skeptical
before the trip, they made me feel at home from the very first day. They always looked out for Max
and me, and I cannot thank them enough for their hospitality and their motivation to show us so many
different things. Thanks a lot, Chris, Anna, Greta and Smith!

Next off, school. Of course, I expected the American school system to be different, however not
as different as it turned out to be. Moving from class to class between every period sure was
something to get used to. I also found it interesting that the teachers were so open to discussions,
they also always tried to make their lessons interactive in some way. Overall, I had a great time at
high school even though I didn't expect it to be that way.

One small weak point I may mention were the excursions and the sightseeing itself. Some days were
weirdly planned out, one of the worst offenders here was Mt. Vernon, where we had to wait for like 4
hours in order to do a 20-minute-long mansion tour. I also found it weird that we had to visit so
many memorials, I mean, they were interesting, but after some time it all got a big boring. Without
a question, the best times were when we were just allowed to roam freely in the area we were
currently in. Again, not really a big deal, but it's something that could have been a bit better.

In order to shift to a more positive side again, I really enjoyed the English-talking aspect of the
trip. Speaking with natives is always different from speaking with people who learned English as a
second language. They speak faster, use different words and phrases and have a different accent.
It's almost like a little challenge. Nevertheless, I pretty much never had any problems
understanding them and communicating, which I'm almost a bit proud of.

To sum it all up, I had an unforgettable time in America. This was due to all the things I
previously mentioned, but also due to a more private reason I won't go into detail about here. I'm
very grateful that our classes got the opportunity to go on this trip in the first place and I
really hope that I'll return to America one day.
