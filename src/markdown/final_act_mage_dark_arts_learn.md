You follow the arch mages steps and fuse your Behelith with your staff. It starts to glow red
instantly. Suddenly, you feel a surge of power flow through you. You embrace the darkness the same
way the staff does. All the others seem to have a similar experience. "Can you feel it, my brothers?
This will give us the power to claim control over this world!", Gandalf says in a voice that sounds
more like a demon than a human. You have been consumed by the darkness, you are now one of them.

Over the next few weeks, you gather an army of dark amalgamations to march towards the capital. Your
body has died, some days ago, but your mind is still active, a part of the hive mind. Together, you
and the other dark mages, all spirits command the army of creatures from the ethereal plane. Only
the arch mage Gandalf still walks on in his human form, leading the charge into an age of darkness.
