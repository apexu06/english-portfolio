My final act is in its simplest form a text adventure. This means that you, the player (or reader),
will be able to make choices which will affect the outcome of a situation or story. I chose this
because I read a similar text in my childhood once where you had to make choices in order to 
navigate a deep and dangerous jungle. I really liked it as it wasn't a story that was set in stone, 
it was rather a story that you could influence and change yourself, a similar principle to what you
would do in a video game. As I really like games or stories with fantasy settings, I set my own 
little adventure in a fantasy world where you can either start as a warrior or mage.
> In order to navigate and make choices, just click the wanted underlined choice at the end of each 
text.

I hope you enjoy your personal adventure as much as I enjoyed creating it.

_Also, special thanks to my friend June for proofreading._
