description: 'You chose to stay and fight the goblins in the tavern.'

You draw your sword and turn towards the goblins. Your first idea was to charge the goblins, however
you remember that you are still a bit drunk, so you decide to play it safer. Slowly, you start to
approach them, trying to keep your balance. They don't notice you at first, so you immediately take
out the first one by stabbing him in the back. To your left another knight joins, who takes up a
battle with two other goblins. You however, are already occupied by two others in front of you.
Without much thinking, you hit one of them right on the shoulder, a clean cut. The goblin falls to
the ground, grunting in pain. But before you can react, the other goblin kicks you in the stomach,
you fold instantly. As the goblin raises his sword to finish you off, the knight from before jumps
in and cuts the goblin in half. You slowly get up, the knight lends you a hand. Together you finish
off the last goblin, who doesn't stand a chance against the two of you. The tavern is saved.

After the fight, the knight introduces himself as Sir Lancelot. He invites you to a drink at the bar 
to celebrate your victory. The tavern owner is so grateful that he offers you a free room for the 
night. In the course of the night, many people come to thank you and give you free drinks. "What a
life!", you think to yourself. From this night on, you are known as the **Hero of the Tavern**.
