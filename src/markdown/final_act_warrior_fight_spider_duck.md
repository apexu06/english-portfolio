description: 'You chose to fight the Spider Duck for its valuable feathers.'
---

You draw your sword, ready for the fight of your life. Spider Ducks are known to be very powerful,
but you are confident in your abilities. You make yourself known by swinging your torch around,
which angers the creature. It hisses at you, with its sharp teeth showing. Before you can make a
move, it starts to charge you. However, you are prepared and land a clean hit into one of its eyes,
while you evade its charge. The Spider Duck screams in pain, but it doesn't stop. It quacks and
sweeps your legs with one of its hybrid legs, you fall to the ground. You try to roll away, but you
are restrained by its many legs. It doesn't show much mercy as it starts to spew a sticky substance
all over you. You can't move, you can hardly breathe, still you realize that you are being turned
into a cocoon, often considered as one of the worst deaths imaginable. 

The death you suffer by suffocation is a painful process, taking many hours, while the Spider Duck 
watches you, waiting for the right moment to feast on your remains.

## You Died!
