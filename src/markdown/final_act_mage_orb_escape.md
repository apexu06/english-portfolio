description: 'You decided to use the orb to escape the battle.'
---

You decide that you want to get away from this battlefield and try to use it again. You lift the orb
up with both hands, concentrate and just like before, after some time, your hands sink into the orb.
Not only that, but you feel the energy flowing through you again and notice how the battlefield 
around you starts to take weird shapes until you are absorbed by the orb completely.

You open your eyes again and find yourself in some kind of fight. A large black knight with a glowing red 
blade fights against a normal-sized human with a green-tinted saber made of light. The knight seems to
talk about how he is the other one's father, but you can't really make sense of it. You quickly use
the orb again, this is not the place you want to be in.

This time, you find yourself in a carriage, riding through a forest. There are three other people
sitting in the carriage. One greets you with an ominous "Oh, you are finally awake." You are not 
sure what this means, so you ask where you are going. The person tells you that all of you are soon
going to be executed in a small village. Shocked by this news, you instantly let the orb transport
you again.

You find yourself in what seems like an old temple. An older man with laurels on his head is
surrounded by many others who seem to be listening to him. They are all dressed in elegant and wide
robes, all colored in white and red. Out of nowhere however, one of the people surrounding the
"leader" pulls out a knife and stabs him. Then all the others join in, stabbing the poor old man to
death. "This must be some sort of nightmare...", you think to yourself as you use the orb.

Wherever you are now it's hard to keep upright. The ground is shaking and there is sand everywhere.
As you look around, you find yourself surrounded by a vast desert. You look down at the ground and
notice that you are standing on some giant sand worm. It's moving extremely fast through the desert,
and you struggle to hold on. You turn your head around and find that many people are riding the same
massive sand worm as you currently are, all of them screaming: "Lisan al Gaib!" You use the orb 
again, hoping to get out of this mess.

Next, you wake up in a city. There's a huge amount of people around you, wearing strange clothes and
screaming in a language you again don't understand. You try to get a better view of the situation,
once you do, you notice that some sort of wall, which is stretching through the whole city, is
getting torn down by a large mass of people. You hope that all this ends soon and use the orb
again.

Now something feels different. You are nowhere and everywhere at the same time. Your body doesn't
exist, but your mind does. You have full control over where you want to go next. Do you wish to go
home or do you want to settle down in a new world?
