description: 'You chose to cast fireball against the bandits.'

The bandits charge you, but you keep a clean head. As you say, _Ignis eos comburet!_, a big
fireball appears in your hand. Now where to throw it... Because you are in a forest, you look for a
tree you can work with. The bandits are about 40 meters away, rapidly approaching. You almost panic,
but then you spot it, the perfect tree, with the perfect angle. As you begin to throw the fireball,
you mumble the words _Explodere insaniam_, which makes the fireball have much more explosive power 
but also makes it harder to control. You take your time, aim your shot and finally throw the 
fireball.  You hit the tree the just bandits just passed by. For a split second nothing happens, 
but then the tree explodes in a thousand pieces, releasing millions of splinters, which impale the 
bandits from behind. They all fall dead to the ground instantly.

You were lucky, only getting hit by a few splinters yourself. You take a deep breath and sit down to
relax for a moment. The fact that you are alive is a miracle, but you wouldn't be hadn't you trusted
your masters wise words. "When in doubt, trust the fireball." You chuckle to yourself, as it reminds
you of the first time you cast a fireball, which almost burned down the entire magic school library.

Nonetheless, you decide to study more pyromancy, as the fireball seems to have saved your life not
once but twice in a short time period. From that day on, you became on with the fireball, using it
for the rest of your life.
