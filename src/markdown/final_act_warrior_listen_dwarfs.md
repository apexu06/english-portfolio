As you listen in on the conversation, you can overhear some very interesting details, like how the
male seemingly flooded the whole once by clogging the toilet or how the woman once managed to burn
their village down by trying to cook a stew. Eventually the female dwarf screams: "You even cheated
on me with _Nettie!_ Who do you think you are?" "I mean, at least it wasn't your sister, right?", he
answers nonchalantly. You can't help but chuckle at his answer, however it seems that your chuckle
was a little too loud, they notice you. "What do you think you're doing here, eavesdropping on us?",
they shout in unison. You try to explain yourself, but they already have their weapons drawn. Before
you can even talk about a peaceful solution, they sprint towards you. However, they are no match
for, you stab her in the stomach first and knock the male one down to the ground, all within two
seconds. Suddenly, the male thrusts his sword towards you, managing to rip open your brand-new armor
and bruise your shoulder. Enraged, you kick him in the face and giving him the final death blow.
Without thinking about the two dwarfs you just killed, you start to inspect your armor, which has
basically become unusable. "How dare they?", you growl in a fit of rage.

Not much later, you return with a bunch of other warriors, ready to take on some dwarfs. Your goal
is the village of the two dwarfs, which you find in a small clearing. The other warriors were easily
convinced to join you on your revenge, as they are still very alcoholized and have a combined IQ of
below room temperature (in Celsius). You storm the village, killing most of the dwarfs, they don't
stand much chance. While you are there you find a new armor, a perfect replacement for the other one
that was destroyed. You leave the village in ruins, satisfied with your revenge.
