You slowly leave your hiding spot and approach them. They don't even notice you at first, they are
very deep into the argument. "Hello there, what's going on here?", you ask them. They both turn
towards you and look at you with a mix of surprise and anger. "Who are you and what are you doing
here?", she asks you. "I'm just a traveler who heard screams and wanted to see what's going on."
"You only heard us because my wife right here doesn't want to understand that she is wrong!", the
male shouts. "Okay, okay, calm down. Tell me what's going on, maybe I can help you two out.", you 
say as you try to defuse the situation. "Well, you see, we just don't like each other anymore. I
don't know how I married such a miserable piece of work! Just look at her!" "How dare you say this,
don't you remember when you clogged the toilet, flooded our whole hut and just said: _Don't care_?
That's what I call a piece of work!", she shouts back. "That was nothing compared to when you wanted
to cook a **stew** and burned down half of our village!", he shoots back. You can't help but be a
bit amused and disturbed at the same time. Suddenly out of nowhere, the female dwarf turns to you
and says in a calm tone: "Hey, you look like a nice guy. Can I come home with you tonight?" You are
too stunned to answer immediately, your brain is still trying to comprehend what's happening and
what's being offered to you here.

The question is, do you accept the offer or do you walk away from this peculiar situation?
