You think to yourself, "What could possibly go wrong?" as you tell the druid that you accept the
weird potion. The druid hands you the vial, the smell becoming stronger as the potion comes closer
to your face. Despite this, you still decide to try it. It starts to burn almost immediately as the
liquid enters your mouth. You pull a wry face but down it in one go, just as you did with the ale
some time ago. At first, you don't feel anything, but after waiting for a few seconds you become a
bit dizzy. You think, "Oh, not again!" as your view fades as you plunge into darkness.

After some time has passed, you wake up once again, but something feels different about your body.
The horror starts to grow as you begin grasping the reality of your situation. You look down
yourself, but it seems like you _shrunk_, not even by a little bit at that. It seems that your height 
has halved, which means that you have become something known as a "Halfling". These people are just
like normal humans, just half their height. You immediately ask the druid in a rather angry and
confused way, "What did you do to me?" "I have made you a part of a greater mission!" he simply
replies. This of course, doesn't answer any of your question, but before you can say anything else,
the druid injects you some fluid. You lose consciousness almost immediately.

As you open your eyes again, which has happened way too many times at this point, you find yourself
surrounded by many other Halflings. You could only describe the place you're in as some sort of
large, vast hall, at least twenty meters tall and many more wide. All of this only furthers your
confusion, you didn't expect your day to turn out this way. "This has to be some sort of nightmare",
you think to yourself. "Oh so you are new here. My condolences." says one of the Halflings behind
you. Apparently you said your thoughts out loud, which isn't very surprising, considering your
current mental state. Immediately, you start searching for some kind of exit, however you're not
very fast, as you aren't fully accustomed to your new body yet. The longer the search, the clearer
it becomes that you won't escape from this place very easily. There is one possible exit, a huge door,
however its shut tight, impossible to open with bare hands. 

Through some more asking around, you find out that all the others have suffered the same fate as 
you. Apparently, the druid wants to overthrow the whole _kingdom_, with an army of Halflings, which 
sounds very insane to you. On the other hand, it couldn't harm to be a direct part of a potential 
revolution, you think to yourself. The kingdom has been mismanaged for years, so maybe this is the 
change it needs. On the other hand, you could also try to escape, by starting a rebellion from the 
inside. 

The choice is yours, what will you do?
