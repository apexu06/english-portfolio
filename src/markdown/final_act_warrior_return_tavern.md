description: 'You chose to not investigate the scream and return to the tavern.'
---

You are too tired to give a damn about a random scream in forest out in the middle of nowhere. You
return to the tavern. The bard is still playing his music, the barkeeper is still serving drinks and 
the people are still dancing. You sit down at your table, order another drink and enjoy the rest of
the evening, drinking ale and enjoying yourself. You may not be the most curious or interesting
person but at least you are having a good time.
