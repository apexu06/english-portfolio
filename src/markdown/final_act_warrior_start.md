You slowly start to open your eyes. Your head is pounding, you can not remember what happened and
how you got here. The tavern you are in is filled with people all dancing, drinking and having a
good time. It seems like you have been here for a while, judging from your almost empty mug of ale.
As you start to look around you notice that you are sat at a table with a group of people, all in
high spirits and seemingly having the time of their lives. You can feel the alcohol in your body, as
your view is slightly blurred with your thoughts spinning. You are offered another drink by the
barkeeper who has problems keeping up with the demand of his guests. 

Do you choose to accept the drink to keep on partying or do you refuse to prepare yourself for a
potential upcoming battle?
