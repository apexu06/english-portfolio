You decide to join the fight, whatever the fight is about. As you watch your new "friends" charge
into battle, you notice that what you thought were wooden sticks are really some sort of mini
cannon. You are not sure how they work, but you are sure that you don't want to be on the receiving
end of one. You saw a guillotine before in the distance, which is a bit more your style. Funnily
enough, you just learned a spontaneous beheading spell last week, a really fun spell in your
opinion. It beheads one random target in your field of vision, however it makes no distinction
between friend or foe. 

You approach the castle walls, where you can read some name written on a
sign: _Bastille_. "Weird name", you think to yourself. Nevertheless, you unleash a lightning storm
on some of the guards, making them drop instantly. Your companions look at you with eyes wide open,
as if you did something they have never seen before. You feel a bit weirded out, but considering
that you are in a different world, you don't think too much about it. You continue to fight, using
different spells and incantations you have learned over the years. There are some spontaneous
beheading, here and there, much to the amusement of your new colleagues. You are not sure if they 
are really your friends, but they seem to be happy with your performance.

Over the next few hours, you manage to find out that you are in a country called _France_, and that
the people speak an odd language called _French_. Also, this battle isn't just any battle, it's some
sort of major revolution, you learn. You are having the time of your life, finally putting all your
spells to good use while helping out in some distant world. You are not sure if you will ever get
back to your own world, but for now you only care about pushing the revolution forward.

## Viva La Revolution!
