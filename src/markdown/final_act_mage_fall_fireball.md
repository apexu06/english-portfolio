Instinctively, you cast **Fireball**. You seemed to get it just right, as suddenly a huge ball of
flame lights up in front of you. Without think too much, you throw it against the stone wall, which
was behind you the whole time you were falling. You fully trusted your masters words by casting the
fireball, as you are still not sure what it's supposed to do. However, suddenly, you can see the
cliff cracking, even while falling with full speed. The cracks spread to the ground, which causes a
great geyser to erupt, right below you. You cannot believe what is happening, but you go with it,
you have no other choice. You brace yourself for the impact with the water and you hit it very soon
after. The initial impact hurts, but you quickly forget about it, as you struggle to stay on top of
the geyser. This doesn't seem like a normal geyser because those wouldn't have the area or the
strength to hold up a person, you found that out the hard way, when you were a kid.

After some time, the geyser seems to get weaker and almost "lowers" you to the ground. You make
contact with the ground again, drenched in water but still alive. Nonetheless, you don't get much
rest, as you see a group of bandits approaching your location, seemingly wanting trouble.

They don't seem to speak your language, but you understand one thing: They don't want to be your
friends. They trade one last word between each other, before they draw their swords and approach
you. You could either run away or cast a fireball, which has helped you before.
