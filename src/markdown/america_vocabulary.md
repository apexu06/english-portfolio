description: 'A short review on how my english has improved during the trip.'
---

Let me start off by saying that I am/was never really satisfied with my English-speaking skills. I
have always found it hard to pronounce some words, so I was a tiny bit worried about all the talking
I would have to do during the trip. Turns out, I was worried for nothing. During the trip, there
were almost zero problems when it came to spoken conversations with the locals. Some people say that
American English is harder to understand than British English, but I found the reverse to be true,
if I compare it with my London holiday last year.

I can't really remember any specific words or phases that I could have picked up, because I mostly
focused on my pronunciation rather than learning new words. That's the much harder part for me, but
honestly I think I did quite well. After the second to third day, I felt much more comfortable and
after that it was a breeze.
